// Here's the coroutine function to run in our Coroutine. It takes an Execution object that is automatically
// created and passed to the coroutine function by Coroutine.Run(). The Execution object allows us to do some
// easy coroutine manipulation (yield, wait until something happens, etc).
// If we want to pause execution, we can call Execution.Yield(). If we want to end execution early,
// just return from the function like usual. If you want to end execution from *outside* this function
// (i.e. with Coroutine.Stop()), then you need to receive that signal by checking Execution.Stopped() from within
// the coroutine function, and return early.
